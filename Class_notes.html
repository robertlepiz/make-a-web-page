            <b>HTML</b> files are the structure of web pages, while <b>CSS</b> are what dictates what the pages look like.
            <br><b>Javascript</b> are the components that change the elements of the <b>HTML</b>. It is important to structure a web page because it becomes much easier to read and to alter the code later.
            When making your own web page, it's a good idea to look at other people's code in order to better understand how to write your own code.

          <p>
            <b>DOM</b> means <em>Document Object Model</em> and is the tree-like structure of a web page and <b>HTML</b> turns tags into elemts in the tree.
            All of the elements in a web page are boxes. When designing a web page from a template, the easiest way to start is by diviing all of the items into boxes. It is important to start with the biggest boxes and then proceed to the smaller ones.

              </p>
              <p>
                Cascading Style sheets are the laws that the <b>HTML</b> page has to follow. These properties can be applied to both individual elemets as well as to its descendants. <b>CSS</b> can be called from the <b>HTML</b> page itself or from its own seperate file. It is ideal to write <b>CSS</b> code on a seperate file.

              </p>
              <p>
                ID's and classes mark elements in order to chage their characteristics in CSS. While classes refer to multiple elemets, ID's refer to unique elements. Headings like <em>h1</em> and <em>h2</em> also help avoid to repetition by allowing you to change multiple elemets using <b>CSS</b>.

              </p>
              <p>
                <b>HTML</b> elements are boxes and each box has 4 components; content, padding, border and margin. It is difficult to fit all of these boxes together on a web page. There are two ways fo dealing with this issue. The first is to set the sizes in terms of a percentange. The second option is to set the <em>box-sizing</em> atribute to <em>border-box</em> for every element. In order to have thow boxes next to each other, it is necessary to add <em>disply:flex</em> to your <b>CSS</b> code.
